# WORKLOG

**Purpose:** Append-only history for completed work.

Use this file for dated session notes, verification summaries, and references to evidence artifacts.

## 2026-04-26 - Operating loop kickoff prompt added

**Type:** workflow_prompt
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Repo Path:** /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
**Git Head:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository
**Worktree:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository

### What changed

- Added `prompts/OPERATING_LOOP_START_PROMPT.md` with a paste-ready CTO ChatGPT startup prompt and a draft first coding-agent prompt for `[BL-001]`.
- Updated `STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, and `README.md` to point to the operating-loop kickoff prompt.
- Preserved `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` as the active implementation queue; no product implementation was started in this workflow slice.

### Verification

- Confirmed the backlog is already recorded as a complete 90-item milestone-level planning artifact.
- Confirmed no CTO-scoped implementation handoff exists in the repo state.
- `python3 scripts/check_state_docs.py` passed.
- `python3 scripts/check_state_docs.py --bootstrap-gate` passed.
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/check_state_docs.py scripts/init_template.py` passed.
- `git status --short --branch` failed because this directory is not currently a Git repository.

### Evidence

- Planning/workflow artifact: `prompts/OPERATING_LOOP_START_PROMPT.md`.

## 2026-04-26 - Bootstrap completed for SupportPlane product baseline

**Type:** bootstrap_baseline
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Repo Path:** /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
**Git Head:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository
**Worktree:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository

### What changed

- Converted the state files from generic template bootstrap placeholders into a SupportPlane product baseline.
- Captured the product definition, target architecture, safety model, stack, MVP order, integrations, backlog, and active queue.
- Recorded external planning evidence for Zammad, GLPI, Asterisk ARI, MeshCentral, OWASP agentic AI security, NIST GAI RMF profile, and EU AI Act timing.
- Fixed the root `PROJECT_DNA.yaml` structure so it is valid YAML.
- Fixed `scripts/init_template.py` so future generated `PROJECT_DNA.yaml` files keep valid YAML indentation.
- Updated `scripts/check_state_docs.py` to parse YAML when PyYAML is available.

### Verification

- Read the required state files and current repo structure directly.
- Verified the local directory path and confirmed no Git repository is currently initialized.
- Verified host/runtime facts with local commands.
- Verified external reference pages through direct browser lookup on 2026-04-26.
- Verified root and fixture hygiene checks, bootstrap gate, root YAML parsing, script compilation, and generated template YAML parsing.

### Evidence

- `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md` entries `EV-2026-04-26-001` through `EV-2026-04-26-008`.

### Remaining Risk

- No app runtime exists yet.
- Branch, HEAD, and clean worktree status cannot be proven until Git is initialized.
- Regulatory/compliance content is architecture guidance only, not legal advice.

## 2026-04-26 - Complete implementation backlog added

**Type:** planning
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Repo Path:** /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
**Git Head:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository
**Worktree:** not proven; directory is not currently a Git repository

### What changed

- Expanded `BACKLOG.md` from an initial bootstrap roadmap into a 90-item milestone-level implementation backlog.
- Covered foundation, MVP 1 ticket-aware AI cockpit, MVP 2 call simulator, MVP 3 operator companion, MVP 4 endpoint diagnostics, MVP 5 remediation, post-MVP integrations, governance, compliance evidence, and production hardening.
- Kept `NEXT_ACTIONS.md` short and active-only.

### Verification

- `python3 scripts/check_state_docs.py` passed.
- `python3 scripts/check_state_docs.py --bootstrap-gate` passed.
- Root YAML files parsed successfully with PyYAML.
- `BACKLOG.md` remains under the configured 260-line hygiene limit.

### Evidence

- Planning artifact: `BACKLOG.md`.
