## 2026-04-29 - BL-106 Evidence Reconciliation

**Type:** evidence_repair
**Status:** RECONCILED
**Repo Path:** /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
**Git Branch:** main
**Git Head:** to_be_recorded_after_reconciliation_commit
**Worktree:** clean_after_reconciliation_commit

### Why reconciliation was needed

The BL-106 final handoff claimed a clean evidence folder, but two screenshots were mismatched:
- `02-cluster-web-header.png` showed a failed login screen instead of the cluster web header.
- `03-zammad-page-proof.png` showed a generic `Loading...` page without actual Zammad proof.

### What changed

- Added `http://localhost:3300` to API CORS origins in `apps/api/src/main.ts`.
- Rebuilt cluster API image `localhost/supportplane-api:local-k8s` with the CORS fix.
- Loaded new image into Kind cluster `supportplane-local` and restarted API Deployment.
- Verified cluster web login now succeeds and header shows DEV/MOCK DATA badge.
- Captured fresh evidence in `output/playwright/session-107-bl106-evidence-reconciliation/`:
  - 20 unique screenshots, 0 duplicates.
  - Zammad proof now shows pod status + API JSON with honest note about railsserver-only asset limitation.
  - Cluster web header now correctly shows logged-in state.
- Deleted stale evidence folder `output/playwright/session-106-bl106-selfhosted-service-topology-final/`.
- Updated `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md` to mark old entry superseded and add reconciled entry.

### Verification

- `curl -s http://localhost:4210/health` returns ok with current git head.
- Browser login to `http://localhost:3300` succeeds as `operator@supportplane.local`.
- Cluster web header shows DEV/MOCK DATA, API: localhost:4110, Auth: local · Store: postgres, Mock mode.
- Zammad API `/api/v1/getting_started` returns JSON with `setup_done: false`.
- All other topology services (OpenBao, NATS, Mailpit, MinIO) remain healthy.
- Local MVP on localhost:4110/3200 still works.

## 2026-04-29 - BL-106 Self-Hosted Service Topology

**Type:** infrastructure_foundation
**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Repo Path:** /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
**Git Branch:** main
**Git Head:** to_be_recorded_after_final_commit
**Worktree:** clean_after_final_commit

### What changed

- Added Kubernetes manifests for self-hosted service topology under `infra/kubernetes/local-podman/integrations/` and `infra/kubernetes/local-podman/data/minio/`:
  - **OpenBao** in `supportplane-integrations`: Deployment + Service + PVC + Secret, image `openbao/openbao:2.2.0`, dev mode with local placeholder root token, health endpoint reachable.
  - **NATS JetStream** in `supportplane-integrations`: StatefulSet + Service + PVC + ConfigMap, image `nats:2.10.24-alpine`, file-backed JetStream enabled. Verified stream `TEST_STREAM` and consumer `TEST_CONSUMER` created, message published and consumed.
  - **Mailpit** in `supportplane-integrations`: Deployment + Service, image `axllent/mailpit:v1.21`, SMTP port 1025 and web UI port 8025. Verified local SMTP test message captured via web API.
  - **MinIO** in `supportplane-data`: Deployment + Service + PVC + Secret, image `minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-04-22T22-12-26Z`. Verified bucket `bl106-bucket` created and object `topology-proof.txt` stored/retrieved.
  - **Zammad** in `supportplane-integrations`: StatefulSet + Service + PVCs + ConfigMap + Secret, image `zammad/zammad:6.4.1-1`, with separate PostgreSQL (`postgres:16-alpine`) and Redis (`redis:7-alpine`) dependencies. Zammad init succeeded (migrations, seed, settings). Railsserver running and responding HTTP 200.
- Documented **Ollama placement decision**: host-controlled service, not in-cluster. Host has AMD GPU (Radeon RX 7700 XT / 7800 XT) and Ollama 0.18.2 with models already installed. In-cluster deployment would waste GPU and complicate AMD pass-through.
- Updated `infra/kubernetes/local-podman/kustomization.yaml` to include all new resources.
- Updated `STATUS.md`, `NEXT_ACTIONS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.yaml`, `docs/EVIDENCE_LOG.md`, `docs/ACCEPTANCE_FREEZES.md`, `docs/SELF_HOSTED_STACK.md`, `docs/LOCAL_KUBERNETES_PODMAN_TARGET.md`, `docs/KUBERNETES_SERVICE_CATALOG.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW_TRUTH.md`, `docs/BOUNDARY_MATRIX.md`, `infra/kubernetes/local-podman/README.md`.
- Created `scripts/bl106_screenshots.js` and canonical evidence folder `output/playwright/session-106-bl106-selfhosted-service-topology-final/` with exactly 20 unique screenshots and 0 duplicates.

### What remains mocked or not implemented

- No SupportPlane real integration with Zammad, OpenBao, NATS, Mailpit, or MinIO.
- Zammad read connector is BL-107.
- Ollama provider integration is BL-108.
- OpenBao credential resolver is BL-109.
- NATS worker bridge is BL-110.
- MinIO evidence persistence is BL-112.
- Mailpit notification capture is BL-113.
- Real writeback remains disabled.
- Credential references remain metadata/placeholder only.
- No production auth, secrets, monitoring, or compliance claims exist.

### Next implementation move

Start BL-107: Zammad sandbox bootstrap and real read connector. Seed deterministic Zammad customer/ticket data and read it through SupportPlane with provenance.
