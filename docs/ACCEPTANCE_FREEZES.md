# ACCEPTANCE_FREEZES.md

**Purpose:** Append-only ledger of accepted user-facing or operator-facing milestones.

Use this when a screen, route, workflow, or other visible milestone is accepted
and must be protected from quiet regression.

## Entry Format

```yaml
- ID: AF-YYYY-MM-DD-001
  Milestone: short milestone name
  Scope: what was accepted
  repo_path: /absolute/path/to/repo
  branch: main
  head: abc1234
  process_or_container: npm dev | docker container name | other
  port_or_base_url: http://localhost:3000
  routes:
    - /
    - /settings
  rebuilt_in_slice: true
  duplicate_runtimes_checked: true
  evidence_refs:
    - EV-YYYY-MM-DD-001
  regression_guard:
    - later work must branch from this accepted lineage
    - route-role changes require explicit backlog scope and new evidence
  Notes: optional
```

## AF-2026-04-26-001: Support Cockpit UI shell (BL-004)

- ID: AF-2026-04-26-001
- Milestone: Support Cockpit UI shell
- Scope: First user-visible Support Cockpit with session list, ticket context, AI context quality, draft note, and audit trail panels.
- repo_path: /home/ff/Documents/Projects/SupportPlane
- branch: main
- head: 51976dbb25d8e8a5bca2100686baa08359dccc39
- process_or_container:
  - node process (NestJS API) on port 4110
  - node process (Next.js dev) on port 3200
- port_or_base_url:
  - http://localhost:4110
  - http://localhost:3200
- routes:
  - /
- rebuilt_in_slice: true
- duplicate_runtimes_checked: true
- evidence_refs:
  - EV-2026-04-26-009
  - EV-2026-04-26-010
  - EV-2026-04-26-011
  - EV-2026-04-26-012
  - EV-2026-04-26-013
  - EV-2026-04-26-014
  - EV-2026-04-26-015
  - EV-2026-04-26-016
  - EV-2026-04-26-017
- regression_guard:
  - Session list must remain createable and selectable.
  - Ticket context load must return mock connector data visibly.
  - AI Context Quality panel must show loaded/missing/warning states.
  - Draft note panel must remain non-persistent with disabled writeback.
  - Audit trail must display events with actor, timestamp, resource, and metadata.
- Notes:
  - This is a mock-first UI shell. No real ticketing system, database, or AI provider is connected.
  - Dev-only CORS is configured on the API and must be replaced before production.

## Guidance

- Do not treat screenshots alone as an acceptance freeze.
- Tie the accepted state to repo truth, runtime truth, and evidence truth.
- If a later report conflicts with the freeze, prove runtime identity before drawing conclusions from git history.
